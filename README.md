tTalk

Description
Monitors clipboard content, maintains a history, and announces content in English or Thai

Usage
The tTalk add-on enhances NVDA by announcing clipboard-related commands in either English or Thai, depending on the selected language. It also maintains a history of clipboard content. Below are the key features and commands:

Switch Language (NVDA+Alt+T): Toggles between English and Thai for command announcements. When switched, NVDA will announce "Switched to English" or "เปลี่ยนเป็นภาษาไทย" (Switched to Thai).
Clipboard Commands: The following keyboard shortcuts are monitored, announced in the selected language, and passed through to perform their default actions (e.g., copying or pasting files in File Explorer):
Ctrl+C: Announces "copy" (English) or "คัดลอก" (Thai) and performs the copy action.
Ctrl+V: Announces "paste" (English) or "วาง" (Thai) and performs the paste action.
Ctrl+X: Announces "cut" (English) or "ตัด" (Thai) and performs the cut action.
Ctrl+Z: Announces "undo" (English) or "ย้อนกลับ" (Thai) and performs the undo action.
Ctrl+A: Announces "select all" (English) or "เลือกทั้งหมด" (Thai) and performs the select all action.
Ctrl+S: Announces "save" (English) or "บันทึก" (Thai) and performs the save action.
All commands are listed under the "tTalk" category in NVDA's Input Gestures dialog (accessible via NVDA menu > Preferences > Input Gestures).
